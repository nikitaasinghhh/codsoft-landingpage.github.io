            <h4>FOUNDATION</h4>
            <p>
              Foundation is a liquid, cream, or powder makeup applied to the face and neck to create an even, uniform color to the complexion, cover flaws and, sometimes, to change the natural skin tone.

            <h4>CONCEALER</h4>
            <p>
              Concealer is similar to foundation except it's generally thicker and hides dark circles, age spots, blemishes and more by hiding pigments and blending these imperfections into the skin.
